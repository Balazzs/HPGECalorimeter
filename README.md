## Installation on Windows

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

I suggest using WSL for a Windows installation, as the native windows Geant4 doesn't support multithread simulations.
WSL is a real Linux system running under windows (now with WSL 2.0 with GUI included), all the advantages of having Linux and Windows without the hassle of dual booting.

Microsoft tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Open a powershell in administrator mode and paste the following:


`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`


`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`

Restart your computer
